# Election-Analysis-Project
Overview:
This Python-based system processes U.S. election data to compute, analyze, and visualize vote counts for fictional candidates Buggs Bunny (BB) and Road Runner (RR) across counties and states. The system supports full-cycle data analysis, from raw vote counts to winner determination and graphical representation.

Files:
Voting-Counties.csv: Contains detailed county-level voting data.
State-Info.csv: Contains summary data at the state level.

Usage:
Place both CSV files in the same directory as main.py.
Run the script with Python.
The script reads the CSVs and outputs election results or analysis.
