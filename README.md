# Election-Analysis-Project
This Python-based system processes U.S. election data to compute, analyze, and visualize vote counts for fictional candidates Buggs Bunny (BB) and Road Runner (RR) across counties and states. The system supports full-cycle data analysis, from raw vote counts to winner determination and graphical representation.
